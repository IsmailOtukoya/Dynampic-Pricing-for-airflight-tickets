# Airline Dynamic Pricing Optimization Project

This repository contains the implementation of a **Dynamic Pricing Optimization** system for airline tickets. The project leverages advanced analytics, machine learning models, and interactive dashboards to optimize ticket pricing based on various factors. It follows a modular approach for maintainability and scalability.

---

## Project Overview

The airline industry operates on dynamic pricing, adjusting ticket prices based on factors like demand, time, seasonality, and competition. This project simulates this process by analyzing historical data and implementing machine learning models to predict optimal prices. 

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Modular Design**
   - **Data Pipeline**: ETL process for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data.
   - **Model Training and Evaluation**: Machine learning pipeline for predicting optimal ticket prices.
   - **Dashboard Creation**: Interactive visualization of insights using tools like Power BI and Looker Studio.

### 2. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - **Key Insights**: Showcases pricing trends, market demand, and competitor analysis.
   - **User-Friendly**: Designed for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

### 3. **Pipeline Workflow**
   - End-to-end automated pipeline from raw data ingestion to predictions.
   - Integration with saved machine learning models for real-time predictions.
